      <h1>Running Minecraft 1.8.8 server on Raspberry pi</h1>
      <nav>
        
          <h1>Well, you read the title right?</h1>
          <h1>It's redicilous, I know... I made it! But why?</h1>
          <h1>A good question, a very good one, but I have no answer for you my friend</h1>
          <h1>Now, instead of joking around, I'll tell you how this works, how I got it working, and how you, yes, YOU can join</h1>
          <h1>The server.jar official minecaft server file runs on a Raspberry Pi Zero W, that is important, cuz that is a really weak Pi.... and the cheapest one</h1>
          <h1>So, It works on 500Mb RAM, idk how and a whopping 1GHz of processing clock speed!</h1>
          <h1>I have to give credit where credit is due, half of this wouldn't be possible without a friend of mine, Anorak1, he actually inspired me to do this in the first place</h1>
          <h1>He has his own website https://anorak01.top/</h1>
          <h1>Anyways, the Pi is set to restart every time the server dies, so.. well It never dies, maybe sometimes</h1>
          <h1>The server IP is 192.168.1.7:25565 there is also a chance to meet me there, I might be playing!</h1>
          <h1>oh, yeah and the server is not optimised it's vanilla, NO MODS! Check out the rest of the website:</h1>
          </h1>Edit:</h1>
          <h1>This actually doesn't work anymore, and I never did cuz I was giving out a local IP, that you couldn't connect to if you aren't on LAN, so yeah</h1>
