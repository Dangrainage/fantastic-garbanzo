      <h1>Vegetable oil as alternative to diesel</h1>
      <nav>
        
          <h1>In the last few weeks, I've been quite obsessed with finding an eco friendly alternative to traditional fuel.</h1>
          <h1>While scouring the internet for any interesting papers. I've found something very interesting</h1>
          <h1>A research paper, written by Zbarcea O,  Scarpete D. and Vrabie V. Showcasing that it is possible to use vegetable oil as diesel</h1>
          <h1>The paper is somewhat vague about how It works. But reading It I found out that emissions from using vegetable oil are,</h1>
          <h1>lower than standar diesel, to quote the paper "emissions from the vegetable oil and its blends are lower"</h1>
          <h1>Which is mighty great, but it also caused engine clogging, and the emissions vary on the mileage of the vehicle</h1>
          <h1>To quote the paper "The emissions vary depending on the condition of the vehicle. The differences may increase with the mileage, the age of the engine</h1>
          <h1>technology and the degree of engine clogging"</h1>
