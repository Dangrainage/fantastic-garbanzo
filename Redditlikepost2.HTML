          <h1>Hello, this website is mostly so I can post stuff without any moderation or other problems</h1>
          <h1>I might post here things like comics I draw, maybe projects I do, and some vlog footage or footage from the games I make</h1>
          <h1>The point here is to create a website using only HTML, no PHP, no JavaScript, no nothing, pure HTML!</h1>
          <h1>I will maybe post things here that I couldn't or, wouldn't post on standard social media like</h1>
          <h1>Youtube, Instagram, or Google +? No, but really I'll post some intersting things.</h1>
          <h1>So, stay posted. (~_^)</h1>
          <h1>Basically understand this as a mini online journal. Thanks for reading!</h1>
